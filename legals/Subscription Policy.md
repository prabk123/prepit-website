# **SUBSCRIPTION POLICY**

**Last Updated:** December 17, 2025

This Subscription Policy describes the terms and conditions applicable to your paid subscriptions for **PrepIt**. By subscribing, you agree to the billing practices described below.

### **1\. SUBSCRIPTION TIERS & BILLING**

PrepIt offers various subscription plans (e.g., Monthly, Annual, or Family plans).

* **Billing Cycle:** Your subscription begins as soon as your initial payment is processed. You will be billed according to the cycle (Monthly or Yearly) you selected at checkout.  
* **Taxes:** Prices may be subject to VAT, GST, or other sales taxes based on your billing region.

### **2\. FREE TRIALS & PROMOTIONS**

If you sign up for a free trial:

* **Automatic Conversion:** At the end of the trial period, your selected payment method will be charged automatically for the full subscription price unless you cancel at least **24 hours before the trial ends**.  
* **One Per User:** Free trials are limited to one per user. Any attempt to exploit multiple trials may result in account termination.

### **3\. AUTOMATIC RENEWALS**

To ensure uninterrupted access to your AI meal plans, all subscriptions are set to **auto-renew**.

* Your subscription will automatically renew for the same duration as your initial term (e.g., a monthly plan renews every month) at the then-current rate.  
* We reserve the right to change our pricing. We will provide at least 30 days' notice via email or in-app notification before any price change takes effect on your next renewal.

### **4\. HOW TO MANAGE OR CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION**

The method for canceling depends entirely on where you purchased your subscription:

#### **A. App Store Subscriptions (iOS/Apple)**

Managed by Apple. To cancel:

2. Navigate to the **Subscription/Billing** tab.  
3. Click Cancel Subscription.  
   Note: You must cancel at least 24 hours before your renewal date to avoid being charged for the next cycle.

### **5\. EFFECTS OF CANCELLATION**

If you cancel, you will remain a "Premium" user until the end of your current paid billing period. Once the period expires:

* Your account will revert to a "Free" tier.  
* You may lose access to certain AI-generated history, premium recipes, or advanced grocery list features.  
* We do not delete your data immediately upon cancellation, allowing you to reactivate your subscription later.

### **6\. FAILED PAYMENTS**

If a renewal payment fails (e.g., expired credit card):

* We will provide a **3-day grace period** for you to update your payment information.  
* If payment is not received after the grace period, your Premium access will be suspended.
