# **REFUND & CANCELLATION POLICY**

**Last Updated:** December 17, 2025

Thank you for using **PrepIt**. We want to ensure you have the best experience possible with our AI-driven meal planning. Because we offer services through both mobile app stores and direct web checkouts, refund procedures vary by payment method.

### **1\. GENERAL CANCELLATION TERMS**

You may cancel your PrepIt subscription at any time.

* **Effect of Cancellation:** Upon cancellation, you will continue to have access to Premium features until the end of your current billing period.  
* **No Partial Refunds:** We do not provide prorated refunds or credits for any partial-month subscription periods or unused AI meal plans.

### **2\. REFUNDS FOR IN-APP PURCHASES (APPLE & GOOGLE)**

If you subscribed to PrepIt via the **Apple App Store** or **Google Play Store**, \[Company Name\] does not have the authority to issue refunds directly. Your purchase is governed by the storefront’s payment policy.

* **Apple App Store:** You must request a refund through Apple. Visit [reportaproblem.apple.com](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://reportaproblem.apple.com) or use the "Report a Problem" link in your emailed receipt.  
* **Google Play Store:** You can request a refund through the Google Play website or via the "Order History" section of the Play Store app.

### **3\. REFUNDS FOR WEB & DIRECT PAYMENTS**

If you subscribed via our **website** (using a Credit Card, Stripe, or Google/Apple Pay on the web), the following terms apply:

* **14-Day "Satisfaction" Window:** If you are unhappy with the AI meal plans provided, you may request a full refund within **14 days** of your initial purchase.  
* **Renewal Charges:** Refunds are generally not provided for automatic renewal charges. We send a reminder email 3 days before annual renewals to help you manage your subscription.  
* **Technical Failures:** If a confirmed technical error on our part (e.g., the AI service is unavailable for more than 48 hours) prevents you from using the service, you may be eligible for a prorated refund.  
* **How to Request:** To request a web-payment refund, email [**support@tryprepit.app**](mailto:support@tryprepit.app)  with your account email and transaction ID.

### **4\. EXCEPTIONS (EU/UK USERS)**

In accordance with regional consumer laws, users in the European Union and United Kingdom have a statutory right to cancel their subscription within **14 days** of the initial sign-up ("Cooling-off Period").

* *Note:* If you log in and generate an AI meal plan during this period, you acknowledge that you are requesting immediate performance of the service and may waive your right to a full refund for that period.

### **5\. CHARGEBACKS**

We encourage you to contact our support team before initiating a chargeback with your bank. Unwarranted chargebacks may result in the permanent suspension of your PrepIt account and a block on future subscriptions.
