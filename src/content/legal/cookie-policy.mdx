This Policy explains how **PrepIt** ("we," "us," or "our") uses cookies and similar tracking technologies (such as pixels, SDKs, and local storage) when you visit our website or use our mobile application.

### **1. WHAT ARE COOKIES AND TRACKERS?**

- **Cookies:** Small text files stored in your browser when you visit a website.
- **Mobile Identifiers/SDKs:** Code blocks within the PrepIt app that act like cookies to help us recognize your device and remember your meal preferences.
- **Local Storage:** Data stored within your app or browser to keep you logged in and save your "offline" grocery lists.

### **2. WHY WE USE THEM**

We use these technologies for three main reasons:

1. **To Make the App Work:** Keeping you logged in and remembering your dietary profile.
2. **To Process Payments:** Ensuring your web-checkout session (via Stripe/Apple Pay) is secure and attributed to your account.
3. **To Improve our AI:** Understanding which recipes are popular so we can refine our AI meal suggestions.

### **3. CATEGORIES OF COOKIES WE USE**

| Category                  | Purpose                                                                                     | Necessity    |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------- |
| **Strictly Necessary**    | Used for login, security, and web-checkout. The app cannot function without these.          | **Required** |
| **Functional**            | Remembers your settings (e.g., Metric vs. Imperial units) and "Favorite" recipes.           | **Optional** |
| **Performance/Analytics** | Helps us see where users get stuck in the app so we can fix bugs. (e.g., Google Analytics). | **Optional** |
| **Marketing**             | Used to show you relevant PrepIt promotions or track the success of our ads.                | **Optional** |

### **4. THIRD-PARTY TRACKERS**

We work with trusted partners to provide our service. These include:

- **Payment Processors (Stripe/Apple/Google):** Use cookies to prevent fraud during checkout.
- **AI Services (OpenAI/Google Cloud):** We use session tokens to manage your AI recipe requests.
- **Analytics (Google Analytics/Mixpanel):** Helps us track app performance.

### **5. YOUR CHOICES (OPTING OUT)**

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject optional cookies.

- **In the App:** You can manage tracking permissions via your device settings (iOS: "Allow Apps to Request to Track"; Android: "Delete Advertising ID").
- **On the Web:** You can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, our web checkout may not function correctly if "Strictly Necessary" cookies are blocked.
- **Global Privacy Control (GPC):** Our website honors "Do Not Track" signals and GPC headers from your browser.

### **6. REGIONAL DISCLOSURES**

- **EU/UK Users:** We will not fire any non-essential cookies until you click "Accept" on our cookie banner.
- **California Users:** We do not "sell" your cookie data. We only "share" it with service providers for the purpose of improving PrepIt.

### **7. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY**

We may update this list as we add new features (like social sharing). Check back periodically for updates.
